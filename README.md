# Creating a neural network from scratch using c++

Summer project to learn c++ and also understand neural networks from the ground up.
<br>

In this project I will build a neural network from scratch using only the standard c++ library. The problem I have chosen to tackle is a common classification task in which my model will give predictions on numbers based on images.

Note: This project uses c++20 if you want to compile anything yourself
